https://codeforces.com/contest/1974/problem/G     ----> nice way where we are 
storing following condition in set , then at each i , we pop out max to compare with a[i]

https://codeforces.com/contest/1203/problem/F1    --> {a,b}   here i needed ki , jitna jayda bada a ho ske , as well simultaneoulsy 
i wanted ki b bhi jitna jyda max ho ske ,    so i did , if(a.first==b.first) return a.second>b.second  
                                                        else return a.first > b.first
But , i  actually have no order prefernce , i just want as max as possible for both , 
so i take max(a+b)  ie. return a.first+a.second>b.first+b.second
